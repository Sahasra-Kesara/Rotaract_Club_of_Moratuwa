                The Rotaract Club of Moratuwa was established on 21st November 2020 with the guidance of the Rotary Club of Moratuwa.
                A casual conversation between two young interactors turned into a reality on November 21, 2020, when the Rotaract Club of Moratuwa was established
                under the guidance of the Rotary Club of Moratuwa. As a relatively young club that completed its charter year three years ago, we take great pride in
                our current standing. Throughout our journey, the Rotaract Club of Moratuwa has achieved significant milestones. Our charter president, Rtr. Nisal Nethmin was
                recognized as the President of the Month in June 2021 within the Rotaract District 3220 SRI LANKA & MALDIVES. Secretary Rtr. Yelani Jayamanna
                received the Spirit of Service Award for the year 2021-22 from the Rotaract Club of Moratuwa. Additionally, our project "e-arena" was honoured as the
                most outstanding E-sports initiative at the 32nd Rotaract District Training Assembly Awards for the year 2021-22. Furthermore, our project
                "Sarubima" received the Gold Award for being the most inspirational initiative together with SL at the same awards ceremony. These
                achievements have fulfilled the citation requirements for the respective
                years, serving as great accomplishments and immense motivation for the
                Rotaractors of Moratuwa, particularly as a community-based club.
                Presently, our club boasts a membership of over 40 Rotaractors, primarily
                aged between 18 and 25. The majority are university students and
                employees in the private sector, while some are pursuing their G.C.E.
                Advanced Level studies. The Rotaractors of RACM consistently receive
                opportunities to enhance their public speaking, compering, video and audio
                editing, PR work, leadership, and communication skills. They are encouraged
                to step out of their comfort zones and explore various fields while serving
                the community.<br>
                Since our charter, our first project, "A December to Remember," has been a
                significant endeavor for us, and we are proud to have organized it for the
                third time this year (2022-2023). This project focuses on assisting an
                economically disadvantaged community by addressing their specific needs.
                We would also like to highlight "Wedikawa" as another noteworthy project
                during our charter year (2020-2021), which emphasizes public relations and
                professional development. In this initiative, we aim to highlight unique and
                often underrated fields such as the art of dubbing and stage drama.
                During the Rotaract year 2021-22, we successfully completed several
                engaging projects. One notable project was "Udana," a community service
                collaboration with the Rotaract Club of the University of Colombo and the
                Rotaract Club of the Faculty of Arts. Through this project, we provided
                necessary daily items to teenage mothers, some of whom became pregnant
                with or without their consent. Additionally, we partnered with the Rotaract
                Club of Saegis Campus for the project "Clean the Queen," where we focused
                on maintaining cleanliness along the coastal area of Panadura Beach.
                Furthermore, our annual "Cricket Fiesta" event strengthened our friendship
                bonds and provided a day filled with fun and camaraderie. We also
                celebrated our Charter Anniversary with a "Paduru Party" to commemorate
                our beginnings.<br>
                The Rotaract Club of Moratuwa is still a budding presence within the evergrowing tree of Rotaract. We firmly believe that one day, we will grow into
                the individuals we are meant to be. We are always ready to welcome new
                members into the RACM family with open arms, not for them to stay forever,
                but to collectively create something that undoubtedly will endure.<br>
